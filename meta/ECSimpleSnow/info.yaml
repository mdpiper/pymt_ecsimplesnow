name: ECSimpleSnow
summary:
  ECSimpleSnow was orginally developed by Ross Brown and Bruce Brasnett
  in Environment Canada (EC). It is an empirical algorithm to melt
  snow according to the surface temperature and increase in snow depth
  according to the precipitation that has fallen since the last
  analysis time. It is a semi-empirical temperature index model. It
  provides a quick and acceptable answer when you only have very
  limited inputs. The one deficiency of the model is that it does not
  take account of the heat budget of the snowpack which means it will
  melt snow too quickly in the spring.
